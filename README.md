# tidytof: An ecosystem for tidy and highly-reproducible CyTOF data analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `tidytof` is to provide an integrated suite of R functions
for CyTOF data analysis using an intuitive and internally consistent set
of design principles. As an extension of the `tidyverse` ecosystem of
data manipulation tools in R, `tidytof` is both performant and
easy-to-use for scientists with a wide range of coding experience
(including beginners).

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidytof from GitHub with the
following command:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("keyes-timothy/tidytof")
```

This readme is still under construction! If you're here and it's not done, come back in a week! ;)
