\title{Read data from an .fcs/.csv file or a directory of .fcs/.csv files.}
\usage{
tof_read_data(path = NULL, sep = "|", panel_info = tibble::tibble())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A file path to a single file or to a directory of files.
The only valid file types are .fcs files or .csv files
containing CyTOF data.}

\item{sep}{Optional. A string to use to separate the antigen name and its associated
metal in the column names of the output tibble. Defaults to "|". Only used if
the input file is an .fcs file.}

\item{panel_info}{Optional. A tibble or data.frame containing information about the
panel used during CyTOF data acquisition. Two columns are required:
"metals" and "antigens". Only used if the input file is a .csv file.}
}
\value{
An [c by m+1] tibble in which each row represents a single cell (of c
total in the dataset) and each column represents a CyTOF measurement
(of m total in the dataset). If more than one .fcs is read at once,
the last column of the tibble (`file_name`) will represent the file name
of the .fcs file from which each cell was read.
}
\description{
Read data from an .fcs/.csv file or a directory of .fcs/.csv files.
}
\examples{
NULL

Notes: Will be buggy in the event that a direcory has a combination of .fcs
and .csv files, as their "panel" attribute may differ (and currently we do
not do anything to check for this or fix it).
