\arguments{
\item{tof_tibble}{A `tof_tbl` or a `tibble`.}

\item{group_cols}{Unquoted names of the columns in `tof_tibble` that should
be used to group cells into separate files. Supports tidyselect helpers. Defaults
to selecting all non-numeric (i.e. non-integer and non-double) columns.}

\item{out_path}{A system path indicating the directory where the output .csv
files should be saved. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.}

to create the output .csv file names. Defaults to "_".}

\description{
This function takes a given `tof_tbl` and writes the single-cell data
it contains into .csv files within the directory located at `out_path`. The
`group_cols` argument specifies how the rows of the `tof_tbl` (each cell)
should be broken into separate .csv files
