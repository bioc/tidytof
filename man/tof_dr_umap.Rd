\usage{
tof_dr_umap(
  tof_tibble,
  umap_vars = where(tof_is_numeric),
  num_comp = 2,
  neighbors = 5,
  min_dist = 0.01,
  learn_rate = 1,
  epochs = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  n_threads = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{tof_tibble}{A `tof_tibble`.}

\item{umap_vars}{Unquoted column names indicating which columns in `tof_tibble` to
use in computing the UMAP embedding. Defaults to all numeric columns
in `tof_tibble`. Supports tidyselect helpers.}

\item{num_comp}{An integer for the number of UMAP components.}

\item{neighbors}{An integer for the number of nearest neighbors used to
construct the target simplicial set.}

\item{min_dist}{The effective minimum distance between embedded points.}

\item{learn_rate}{Positive number of the learning rate for the optimization
process.}

\item{epochs}{Number of iterations for the neighbor optimization.
See \code{\link[uwot]{umap}} for details.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean indicating if run details should be logged to the
console. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{n_threads}{Number of threads to use during UMAP calculation. Defaults
to 1.}

\item{...}{Optional. Other options to be passed as arguments to \code{\link[uwot]{umap}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the same number of rows as `tof_tibble`, each representing
a single cell. Each of the `num_comp` columns represents each cell's embedding
in the calculated UMAP space.
}
\description{
This function calculates a UMAP embedding from single-cell data in a `tof_tibble`.
