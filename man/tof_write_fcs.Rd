\usage{
tof_write_fcs(
  tof_tibble,
  group_vars = where(~!(purrr::is_integer(.x) || purrr::is_double(.x))),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{tof_tibble}{A `tof_tibble`.}

\item{group_vars}{Unquoted names of the columns in `tof_tibble` that should
be used to group cells into separate files. Supports tidyselect helpers. Defaults
to selecting all non-numeric (i.e. non-integer and non-double) columns.}

\item{out_path}{A system path indicating the directory where the output .csv
files should be saved. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.}

\item{sep}{Delimiter that should be used between each of the values of `group_vars`
to create the output .fcs file names. Defaults to "_".}
}
\value{
This function does not return anything. Instead, it has the side-effect
of saving .fcs files to `out_path`.
}
\description{
This function takes a given `tof_tibble` and writes the single-cell data
it contains into .fcs files within the directory located at `out_path`. The
`group_vars` argument specifies how the rows of the `tof_tibble` (each cell)
should be broken into separate .fcs files
