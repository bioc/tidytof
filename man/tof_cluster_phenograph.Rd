\title{Perform PhenoGraph clustering on CyTOF data.}
\usage{
tof_cluster_phenograph(
  tof_tibble,
  cluster_cols = where(tof_is_numeric),
  num_neighbors = 30,
  seed,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tof_tibble}{A `tof_tbl` or `tibble`.}

\item{cluster_cols}{Unquoted column names indicating which columns in `tof_tibble` to
use in computing the PhenoGraph clusters. Defaults to all numeric columns
in `tof_tibble`. Supports tidyselect helpers.}

\item{num_neighbors}{An integer indicating the number of neighbors to use when
constructing PhenoGraph's k-nearest-neighbor graph. Smaller values emphasize
local graph structure; larger values emphasize global graph structure (and
will add time to the computation). Defaults to 30.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for the FlowSOM clustering.
Setting this argument explicitly can be useful for reproducibility purposes.
Defaults to a random integer}

\item{...}{Optional additional parameters that can be passed to \code{\link[Rphenograph]{Rphenograph}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one column named `.phenograph_cluster`. This column will contain an
integer vector of length `nrow(tof_tibble)` indicating the id of
the PhenoGraph cluster to which each cell (i.e. each row) in `tof_tibble` was assigned.
}
\description{
This function performs PhenoGraph clustering on CyTOF data using a user-specified
selection of input variables/CyTOF measurements. It is mostly a convenient
wrapper around \code{\link[Rphenograph]{Rphenograph}}.
