\title{Use tidytof's opinionated heuristic for extracted a high-dimensional cytometry panel's metal-antigen pairs
from a flowFrame (read from a .fcs file.)}
\usage{
tof_find_panel_info(input_flowFrame)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_flowFrame}{a raw flowFrame (just read from an .fcs file) from which
a high-dimensional cytometry panel should be extracted}
}
\value{
A tibble with 2 columns (`metals` and `antigens`) that correspond to the
metals and antigens of the high-dimensional cytometry panel used during data acquisition.
}
\description{
Using the character vectors obtained from the `name` and `desc` columns of
the parameters of the data of a flowFrame, figure out the high-dimensional cytometry panel used
to collect the data and return it as a tidy tibble.
