### Preprocessing with `tof_preprocess()`

Generally speaking, the raw ion counts measured for each analyte on a mass cytometer (the content of raw FCS files obtained directly from a mass cytometer) need to be transformed before CyTOF data analysis. Common preprocessing steps may include variance-stabilizing transformations - such as the hyperbolic arcsine (arcsinh) transformation or a log transformation - scaling/centering, and/or denoising.

To perform standard preprocessing tasks with `{tidytof}`, use `tof_preprocess`. `tof_preprocess`'s default behavior is to apply the arcsinh transformation (with a cofactor of 5) to each numeric column in the input `tof_tibble` as well as to remove the gaussian noise that Fluidigm software adds to each ion count (this noise is added for visualization purposes, but for most analyses, removing it is recommended).

As an example, we can preprocess `{tidytof}`'s built-in `phenograph_data` `tof_tibble` and see how our first few measurements change before and after.

```{r}
# before preprocessing
phenograph_data %>% 
  select(cd45, cd34, cd38) %>% 
  head()
```


```{r}
# after preprocessing
phenograph_data %>% 
  # perform preprocessing
  tof_preprocess() %>% 
  # inspect new values
  select(cd45, cd34, cd38) %>% 
  head()
```

To alter `tof_preprocess`'s default behavior, change the `channel_cols` argument to specify which columns of `tof_tibble` should be transformed. Alter the `transform_fun` argument to specify a vector-valued function that should be used to transform each of the `channel_cols`. For example, suppose we want to center and scale each of our numeric columns instead of arcsinh-transforming them: 

```{r}
phenograph_data %>% 
  # preprocess
  tof_preprocess(transform_fun = scale) %>% 
  # inspect new values
  select(cd45, cd34, cd38) %>% 
  head()
```

To keep the gaussian noise added by Fluidigm software (or if you are working with a dataset that does not have this noise), set the `undo_noise` argument to `FALSE`.

### Postprocessing with tof_postprocess

As a final note, note that the built-in function `tof_postprocess` works nearly identically `tof_preprocess`, but provides different default behavior (namely, applying the reverse arcsinh transformation with a cofactor of 5 to all numeric columns. See `?tof_postprocess` for details).

```{r}
phenograph_data %>% 
  select(cd45, cd34, cd38) %>% 
  head()

# after preprocessing and post-processing, the data are the same 
# except that the re-added noise component is different for each value 
phenograph_data %>% 
  tof_preprocess() %>% 
  tof_postprocess(redo_noise = TRUE) %>% 
  select(cd45, cd34, cd38) %>% 
  head()
```
