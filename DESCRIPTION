Description: An interactive scientific data analysis pipeline for mass
    cytometry (CyTOF) data built using tidy data principles.  It is
    specifically designed to play well with the tidyverse suite of data
    cleaning and analysis tools, with functionality for input/output of
    mass cytometry files, data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering,
    visualization, modeling, and quality-of-life functions.
