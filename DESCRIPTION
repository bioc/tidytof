Description: This package implements an interactive, scientific analysis
    pipeline for high-dimensional cytometry data built using tidy data principles.  
    It is specifically designed to play well with both the tidyverse and 
    Bioconductor software ecosystems, with functionality for reading/writing 
    data files, data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering,
    visualization, modeling, and other quality-of-life functions. tidytof 
    implements a "grammar" of high-dimensional cytometry data analysis.
