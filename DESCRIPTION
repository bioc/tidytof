Description: An interactive scientific data analysis pipeline for high-dimensional
    cytometry data built using tidy data principles.  It is
    specifically designed to play well with the tidyverse suite of data
    cleaning and analysis tools, with functionality for reading/writing data
    files, data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering,
    visualization, modeling, and other quality-of-life functions. Implements a 
    "grammar" of single-cell data analysis.
