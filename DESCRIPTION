Description: A data analysis pipeline for mass cytometry (CyTOF) data
    built using tidy data principles.  It is specifically designed to play
    well with the tidyverse suite of data cleaning and analysis tools,
    with functionality for input/output of mass cytometry files, data
    cleaning, preprocessing, clustering, visualization, modeling, and
    quality-of-life functions.
